# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a Rust version of the s2n-tls library. The goal is to create a memory-safe, high-performance TLS implementation in Rust that maintains compatibility with the existing s2n-tls C implementation. The Rust implementation will leverage Rust's safety guarantees while maintaining the same performance characteristics as the C version.

### s2n-tls Development Principles

The Rust implementation must adhere to the following s2n-tls development principles:

1. **Maintain an excellent TLS/SSL implementation** - Although it's hidden "under the hood", TLS/SSL is the direct interface with customers and end-users. Good performance and security are critical to a positive experience.

2. **Protect user data and keys** - Above all else, the implementation must ensure that user data and private keys are being handled correctly and carefully. Security is often a matter of trade-offs and costs; we should always strive to increase the costs for attackers whenever the tradeoffs are acceptable to users.

3. **Stay simple** - Write as little code as necessary, omit rarely used optional features and support as few modes of operation as possible. We will also promote and encourage changes that reduce the size of our code base.

4. **Write clear readable code with a light cognitive load** - The code must be concise, easy to follow and legible to a proficient Rust programmer. The code should be organized in a way that divides the implementation up into small units of work, with the entire context necessary at hand. We should also minimize the number of branches in our code, the depth of our call stacks, and the number of members in our structures.

5. **Defend in depth and systematically** - Great care and attention to detail is required to write good code, but we also use automation and mechanistic processes to protect against human error.

6. **Be easy to use and maintain sane defaults** - It should be low effort, even for a novice developer, to use the implementation in a safe way. We also shouldn't "pass the buck" and place the burden of subtle or complicated TLS-specific decision making upon application authors and system administrators.

7. **Provide great performance and responsiveness** - TLS/SSL is rapidly becoming ubiquitous. Even small inefficiencies and overhead can become significant when multiplied by billions of users and quintillions of sessions.

8. **Stay paranoid** - The implementation operates in a security critical space. Even with the most precautionary development methods it is impossible to guarantee the absence of defects. A subtle one-byte error on a single line may still cause problems.

9. **Make data-driven decisions** - Opinions can differ on security best practices, sometimes in contradictory ways. Where possible, we are guided by facts and measurable data.

#### Priorities

When weighing up difficult implementation trade-offs our ordered set of priorities are:

1. Security
2. Readability
3. Ease of use
4. Performance

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core TLS Protocol Implementation

**User Story:** As a security-focused developer, I want a memory-safe TLS implementation in Rust, so that I can benefit from Rust's safety guarantees while maintaining high performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. When implementing the TLS protocol in Rust then the implementation MUST comply with RFC 8446 (TLS 1.3) specifications.
2. When the implementation is complete then it MUST support TLS 1.3 as the initial version.
3. When the implementation matures then it SHOULD support TLS 1.2, TLS 1.1, and TLS 1.0 in future iterations.
4. When implementing cryptographic operations then the implementation MUST use aws-lc-rs as the cryptographic library.
5. When implementing the TLS protocol then the implementation MUST be written in idiomatic Rust, avoiding the use of `unsafe` code whenever possible.
6. When writing Rust code then the implementation MUST avoid using panic!, unwrap(), or expect() in production code, instead using Result with proper error types.
7. When designing modules then the implementation MUST use minimum necessary visibility modifiers, preferring pub(crate) for internal API.
8. When converting between types then the implementation SHOULD implement From and TryFrom traits where appropriate.
9. When implementing functions then they MUST NOT exceed 90 lines of code.
10. When defining error types then the implementation MUST use the thiserror crate.
11. When declaring variables then they MUST only be mutable when absolutely necessary.
12. When designing functions then they MUST be responsible for a small, single unit of work when possible, to make them easy to understand and compose into other functions.

### Requirement 2: Performance Parity

**User Story:** As a performance-critical application developer, I want the Rust TLS implementation to match the performance of s2n-tls, so that I don't sacrifice speed for safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. When benchmarking the Rust implementation then it MUST demonstrate performance comparable to the C s2n-tls implementation for connection establishment.
2. When measuring throughput then the Rust implementation MUST achieve data transfer rates equivalent to s2n-tls.
3. When measuring memory usage then the Rust implementation SHOULD maintain memory efficiency comparable to s2n-tls.
4. When profiling CPU usage then the Rust implementation SHOULD show similar or better CPU utilization patterns compared to s2n-tls.

### Requirement 3: Interoperability with s2n-tls

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the Rust TLS implementation to be fully interoperable with s2n-tls, so that I can gradually migrate systems without compatibility issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. When given the same input then the Rust implementation MUST produce identical output as s2n-tls.
2. When establishing connections between Rust and C implementations then they MUST successfully negotiate and communicate.
3. When processing TLS handshakes then the Rust implementation MUST generate wire-compatible messages with s2n-tls.
4. When handling TLS records then the Rust implementation MUST maintain format compatibility with s2n-tls.

### Requirement 4: Memory Safety

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want to leverage Rust's memory safety guarantees, so that common memory-related vulnerabilities are eliminated by design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. When implementing buffer handling then the code MUST use Rust's safe abstractions instead of C-style memory management.
2. When implementing the TLS protocol then the code MUST NOT require the safety mechanisms present in s2n-tls (like s2n_stuffer, s2n_blob, s2n_array).
3. When handling errors then the implementation MUST use Rust's Result type for error propagation instead of error codes.
4. When the implementation is complete then it MUST pass memory safety analysis tools specific to Rust.
5. When implementing memory manipulation then the code MUST use the zerocopy crate to safely incorporate zero-cost memory operations.

### Requirement 5: API Design

**User Story:** As an application developer, I want a clean, idiomatic Rust API for the TLS implementation, so that I can easily integrate it into Rust applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. When designing the API then it MUST follow Rust idioms and conventions.
2. When implementing the API then it MUST provide blocking versions of core functions.
3. When exposing functionality then the API MUST be well-documented with examples.
4. When designing error handling then the API MUST use Rust's Result type with custom error types.
5. When implementing the API then it MUST provide a similar feature set to s2n-tls while being idiomatic Rust.

### Requirement 6: Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing of the Rust TLS implementation, so that I can be confident in its correctness and security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. When implementing features then each component MUST have unit tests with high coverage.
2. When implementing the TLS protocol then the code MUST pass interoperability tests with other TLS implementations.
3. When testing security then the implementation MUST be validated against known TLS vulnerabilities and attack vectors.
4. When testing compatibility then the implementation MUST be verified against the TLS protocol test suite.
5. When implementing cryptographic operations then the code MUST pass cryptographic validation tests using aws-lc-rs.
6. When implementing a new Rust API then the implementation MUST include corresponding differential fuzz tests that ensure equivalence with the corresponding API in s2n-tls, potentially using s2n-tls Rust bindings.

### Requirement 7: Demonstration and Usability

**User Story:** As a developer evaluating the Rust TLS implementation, I want a simple executable or CLI tool that demonstrates the implementation's functionality, so that I can easily verify its compatibility with s2n-tls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. When the implementation is complete then it MUST include a demo executable or CLI tool.
2. When running the demo tool then it MUST successfully establish a TLS handshake with the C s2n-tls implementation.
3. When using the demo tool then it MUST provide clear output showing the handshake process and connection details.
4. When running the demo tool then it MUST support basic TLS client and server modes.
5. When using the demo tool then it MUST demonstrate data transfer between Rust and C implementations.
